# Kroma `v1.3.1` Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions to upgrade from Kroma `v1.2.0` to `v1.3.1`.
For more details about `v1.3.1`, please refer the [release note](https://github.com/kroma-network/kroma/releases/tag/v1.3.1).
This upgrade includes upstream of Optimism [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.4.0).
This upgrade includes Delta upgrade, which enables Kroma-batcher to post batch data to L1 using 
[span batch](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/span-batches.md). 
So all full nodes and validators must complete the upgrade before the Delta upgrade is activated.
The activation time of Delta upgrade is scheduled as below:

- Kroma sepolia: `Tue Feb 20 2024 08:00:00 UTC`
- Kroma mainnet: `Wed Feb 28 2024 08:00:00 UTC`

## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_GETH=v0.4.3
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.3.1
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.3.1
```

Also, additional fields are added to `rollup.json`. Please check your `rollup.json` and make sure that the following
fields are added appropriately. You can also refer the modified [`rollup.json`](../config/sepolia/rollup.json).

For Kroma sepolia,
```json
{
  "delta_time": 1708416000
}
```

For Kroma mainnet,
```json
{
  "delta_time": 1709107200
}
```

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator up -d
```

## Upgrade Failure

If your kroma-node fails to upgrade, it will be unable to derive span batches after the Delta upgrade.
You may encounter logs like the following:

```
2024-02-22 14:59:18 t=2024-02-22T05:59:18+0000 lvl=warn msg="Derivation process temporary error"     attempts=1 err="engine stage failed: temp: cannot accept span batch in L1 block 0x...:100000 at time 1708417920"
```

In this case, you must stop and upgrade your kroma-node with the correct version and `rollup.json` within the sequencing
window(12 hours).
